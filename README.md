# Basic Image Resizer

Basic Image Resizer is what it says in the title, a very simple JPG and PNG image resizer. Program is very basic at the moment, but I plan to add more features as the project is ongoing.

The features it currently contains are

1. Single File Resizing - Select the file to resize, select the desired width and height of output file, select output directory and name of new file, then a new image file with the entered parameters will be created.
2. Bulk File Resizing - Select the directory containing files that you want resized, select Output directory, files will be outputted in the set directory with resized_ prefixed to the filename to allow user to know the file is the resized version.

Dependencies

- Tkinter - for GUI
- Pillow - Image Library (performs the actual resizing of the files).
- OS - used for working with file directories and file paths (to select and output files).

Note:

I am a person who works in IT Support and not a programmer. I just like to try some programming in my spare time. I would love to strengthen my skills to become more competent with programming in the future and I hope building these small programs will aid with my learning.
